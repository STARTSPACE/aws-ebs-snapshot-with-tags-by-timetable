## Automatic EBS Volume Snapshot Creation & Clean-Up Script

# Modified by STARTSPACE Cloud - snapshots executes by tag selections and can be started by any user in sudo group
# https://www.startspace.ru/
#
# PURPOSE: This Bash script can be used to take automatic snapshots of your Linux EC2 instance. Script process:
# - Gather a list of all volume IDs where tag attached
# - Take a snapshot of each attached volume
# - The script will then delete all associated snapshots taken by the script that are older than 7 days
